Our pipeline, referred to as PointAR, takes a single RGB-D image captured from the mobile camera and a 2D location in that image, and estimates a 2nd order spherical harmonics coefficients which can be directly utilized by rendering engines for indoor lighting in the context of augmented reality. Our key insight is to formulate the lighting estimation as a learning problem directly from point clouds, which is in part inspired by the Monte Carlo integration leveraged by real-time spherical harmonics lighting. While existing approaches estimate lighting information with complex deep learning pipelines, our method focuses on reducing the computational complexity. Through both quantitative and qualitative experiments, we demonstrate that PointAR achieves lower lighting estimation errors compared to state-of-the-art methods. Further, our method requires an order of magnitude lower resource, comparable to that of mobile-specific

lighting provides the foundation for achieving spatially-variant photorealistic 3D rendering, a desirable property for mobile augmented reality applications. However, in practice, estimating omnidirectional lighting can be challenging due to limitations such as partial panoramas of the rendering positions, and the inherent environment lighting and mobile user dynamics. A new opportunity arises recently with the advancements in mobile 3D vision, including built-in high-accuracy depth sensors and deep learning-powered algorithms, which provide the means to better sense and understand the physical surroundings. Centering the key idea of 3D vision, in this work, we design an edge-assisted framework called Xihe to provide mobile AR applications the ability to obtain accurate omnidirectional lighting estimation in real time.",{"type":17,"tag":18,"props":563,"children":564},{},[565],{"type":42,"value":566},"Specifically, we develop a novel sampling technique that efficiently compresses the raw point cloud input generated at the mobile device. This technique is derived based on our empirical analysis of a recent 3D indoor dataset and plays a key role in our 3D vision-based lighting estimator pipeline design. To achieve the real-time goal, we develop a tailored GPU pipeline for on-device point cloud processing and use an encoding technique that reduces network transmitted bytes. Finally, we present an adaptive triggering strategy that allows Xihe to skip unnecessary lighting estimations and a practical way to provide temporal coherent rendering integration with the mobile AR ecosystem. We evaluate both the lighting estimation accuracy and time of Xihe using a reference mobile application developed with Xihe's APIs. Our results show that Xihe takes as fast as 20.67ms per lighting estimation and achieves 9.4% better estimation accuracy than a state-of-the-art neural
