interactivity.\nLighting estimation, a task that aims to estimate omnidirectional lighting from limited environment observations, is at the key position of pursuing photorealistic and visually coherent rendering in AR.\nTraditionally, high-quality environment lighting is acquired using physical devices like light probes or 360° cameras.\nSuch physical approach has satisfied the needs of

frameworks in favor of their abilities to estimate environment lighting from single or multiple camera images.\nHowever, in complex real-world scenarios, such models often fail to adapt, as estimating 360° environment lighting from a low FoV camera image is a highly unconstrained task.\nThe deployment time difficulties challenges the traditional definition of lighting estimation, which aims to use image color and structure clues to estimate the environment lighting.\nMy past research has focused on leveraging user, device and environment dynamics to opportunistically generate lighting without
