augmented reality (AR) applications rely on omnidirectional environment lighting to render photorealistic virtual objects.\nWhen the virtual objects consist of reflective materials, such as a metallic

In recent years, emerging AR applications raise new standards for environment sensing on mobile devices in favor of the pursuit of photorealism. Lighting estimation, a task that aims to estimate omnidirectional lighting from limited environment observations, is at the key position of pursuing photorealistic and visually coherent rendering in AR. Traditionally, high-quality environment lighting is acquired using physical devices like light probes or 360Â° cameras.
