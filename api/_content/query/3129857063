However, in practice, estimating omnidirectional lighting can be challenging due to limitations such as partial panoramas of the rendering positions, and the inherent environment lighting and mobile user dynamics. A new opportunity arises recently with the advancements in mobile 3D vision, including built-in high-accuracy depth sensors and deep learning-powered algorithms, which provide the means to better sense and understand the physical surroundings. Centering the key idea of 3D vision, in this work, we design an edge-assisted framework called Xihe to provide mobile AR applications the ability to obtain accurate omnidirectional lighting estimation in real time."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Specifically, we develop a novel sampling technique that efficiently compresses the raw point cloud input generated at the mobile device. This technique is derived based on our empirical analysis of a recent 3D indoor dataset and plays a key role in our 3D vision-based lighting estimator pipeline design. To achieve the real-time goal, we develop a tailored GPU pipeline for on-device point cloud processing and use an encoding technique that reduces network transmitted bytes. Finally, we present an adaptive triggering strategy that allows Xihe to skip unnecessary lighting estimations and a practical way to provide temporal coherent rendering integration with the mobile AR ecosystem. We evaluate both the lighting estimation accuracy and time of Xihe using a reference mobile application developed with Xihe's APIs. Our results show that Xihe takes as fast as 20.67ms per lighting estimation and achieves 9.4% better estimation accuracy than a state-of-the-art neural network."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"h1","props":{"id":"mobisys21-paper"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"MobiSys'21 Paper"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"strong","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Xihe: A 3D Vision-based Lighting Estimation Framework for Mobile Augmented Reality"}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"em","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Yiqin Zhao and Tian Guo"}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://github.com/cake-lab/Xihe/blob/main/xihe_mobisys21.pdf","rel":["nofollow","noopener","noreferrer"],"target":"_blank"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"strong","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"img","props":{"alt":"","src":"/assets/img/project/xihe/arxiv-paper-thumbnails.png"},"children":[]}]}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"code","props":{"code":"@InProceedings{xihe_mobisys2021,\n    author=\"Zhao, Yiqin\n    and Guo, Tian\",\n    title=\"Xihe: A 3D Vision-based Lighting Estimation Framework for Mobile Augmented Reality\",\n    booktitle=\"The 19th ACM International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services\",\n    year=\"2021\",\n}\n","language":"bibtex"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"pre","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"code","props":{"__ignoreMap":""},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"@InProceedings{xihe_mobisys2021,\n    author=\"Zhao, Yiqin\n    and Guo, Tian\",\n    title=\"Xihe: A 3D Vision-based Lighting Estimation Framework for Mobile Augmented Reality\",\n    booktitle=\"The 19th ACM International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services\",\n    year=\"2021\",\n}\n"}]}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"h1","props":{"id":"acknowledgement"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Acknowledgement"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"We thank all anonymous reviewers, our shepherd, and our artifact evaluator Tianxing Li for their insight feedback.\nThis work was supported in part by NSF Grants."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"more-projects","props":{":links":"[\"/project/point-ar\"]","title":"Related Projects"},"children":[]}]},"date":"2021-08-23T00:00:00.000Z","thumbnail":"/assets/img/project/xihe/thumbnail.png","tag":"research","layout":"default","_type":"markdown","_id":"content:project:xihe.md","_source":"content","_file":"project/xihe.md","_extension":"md"}]
